                           ------------------------

- 2 September 2005 -

	* Fix NetworkInterface infinite loop on NetworkInterface::find().
	  This part gets executed when the system does not have ::getifaddrs()
	  and has no support for IPv6. [done]

- 31 August 2005 -

	* Fix NetworkInterface::getNetworkInterfaces() so that
	  NetworkInterface::toString() will output data correctly. [done]

- 29 August 2005 -

	* Create a portable stdint.h. [done]
	* Function inet_pton and inet_ntop are not available on
	  some systems so be sure to handle this case. [done]
