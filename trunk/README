                           Frog Framework README File
                           --------------------------                           

This framework provides an easy to use, reusable, optimized, and portable suite
of C++ classes. It takes away complexity by handling all low-level work, thus
speeding initial development, resulting in fewer bugs, and lowering maintenance
costs.

More information about the Frog Framework can be found at its homepage at 
http://frog.berlios.de.

You can build the API documentation yourself with the following command:

	$ make -f Makefile.d

The above command builds the API documentation which can be found in the /doc
directory.

Please read the LICENSE.txt file for licensing information.

Have fun!
